# Django-Blog
## Description
This is a project I have made following a tutorial on youtube that Corey Schafer made. It went more into the user creation and profiles than your typical "Django-Blog" Tutorial. So I decided to follow it and this is what I have created. I will be adding more features to it as I continue to advance through my python career.

## How to install
 
Clone This Project (Make Sure You Have Git Installed)
```
https://github.com/Blademaster680/Django-Blog.git
```
Install Dependencies 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set Database (Make Sure you are in directory same as manage.py)
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
Create SuperUser 
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Once you have done all these steps you can start populating your blog.
